# Scratch

This repository hosts the code for Scratch Web Solutions' website. Scratch Web Solutions is operated by Spencer Varzandeh and Daniel Sobczak.

Organization:
HTML files are placed directly inside of the root folder. CSS, JavaScript, and images are all placed within subfolders.
CSS is written in styles.css, but minified.css will be what the website loads to increase load speeds. CSS code within styles.css will be manually minified and copied into minified.css.



!TODO!
Decide on site architecture, decide on web features.

AT DEVELOPMENT:
Code mobile-first, then add media queries to edit desktop page appearence for PCs.

# Scratch

This repository hosts the code for Scratch Web Solutions' website. Scratch Web Solutions is owned and operated by Spencer Varzandeh and Daniel Sobczak.

Organization:
HTML files are placed directly inside of the root folder. CSS, JavaScript, font .ttf files, and images are all placed within subfolders.
CSS is written in styles.css, but minified.css will be what the website loads to increase load speeds. CSS code within styles.css will be manually minified and copied into minified.css.

. hamburger menu sometimes not showing on mobile. move flexbox to left to correct?
